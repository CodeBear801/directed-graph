Hi, I'm Ian Mulvany, I'm VP of new Product development for [Mendeley.com][mendeley]. You can find out more about me at [mulvany.net][me].

This blog is generated using the [jekyll][jekyll] templating engine, and it is hosted on [github][github]. The design has been very gratefully lifted from the very talented [Matt Foster][matt], and the background image was taken at the Alhambra.
