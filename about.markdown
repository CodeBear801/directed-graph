Hi, I'm Ian Mulvany, I'm VP of new Product development for [Mendeley.com][mendeley].  You can find out more about me at [mulvany.net][me].

This is a blog about academic topics that interest me, such as graph theory, recommendation systems and physics.  It is also about the research enterprise, in particular academic publishing, knowledge discovery and the impact of web technology on all of this.

All of the content on this blog represents my own personal opinion, and not that of my employer, whoever that happens to be at any given time. 

This blog is generated using the [jekyll][jekyll] templating engine, and it is hosted on [github][github].  The design has been very gratefully lifted from the very talented [Matt Foster][matt].  You can clone this blog from [my repo][dg] for this blog.
