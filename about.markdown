Hi, I'm Ian Mulvany, I'm VP of new Product development for [Mendeley.com][mendeley]. You can find out more about me at [mulvany.net][me].

All of the content on this blog represents my own personal opinion, and not that of my employer, whoever that happens to be at any given time. If I ever become self-employed this blog will also continue in that circumstance to not reflect my professional opinion, so if there is something on here that you won't agree with under those circumstances, then you can not blame me for that.

This blog is generated using the [jekyll][jekyll] templating engine, and it is hosted on [github][github]. The design has been very gratefully lifted from the very talented [Matt Foster][matt], and the background image was taken at the Alhambra.
