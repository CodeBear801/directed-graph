<div> <p>Below follows a long comment that I posted to an article on O'Reilly Radarabout patents.</p><p>The original blog post is here:http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/09/three_vantage_p.html</p><p>There is an interesting compliment to the patent system in the domain ofassigning credit to ideas, which is the academic peer-review system.</p><p>The inventor of the idea in the case of academia is the author. Theequivalent to the patent office is the editorial board of the academicjournal that the author submits to.</p><p>There is an idiosyncratic historical connection between the two systems too.Einstein famously worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, beforebecoming a published academic.</p><p>At the time that Einstein was working the volume of patent applications wasprobably on a par with the submission rate of academic papers to peerreviewed journals, though I have no figures to back this up. In both casesan idea was submitted, examined by experts for originality and eitheraccepted, granting the creator rights, or rejected, sending them back to thedrawing board.</p><p>Fast forward to today and it seems that on the whole the two systems, workin almost the completely opposite manner from one another.</p><p>The peer review system continues to work much as it used to. An idea issubmitted, reviewed, in most cases rejected initially, tweaked, re-submittedand possibly accepted. Scientists for the most part are looking for peerrecognition though publication, and the career rewards that come with thatthrough tenure and increased likelihood of earning academic grants. Themicro-bio and nano fields are diverging from this template, but I'll getback to that at the end. I would classify this system as one in which theinterrogation of the idea happens before the laurel is bestowed on theapplicant. Contrary claims or claims of prior art appear as new publicationsin an ongoing conversation, but it is very rare for the reward (the citablepaper) to be retracted. Working as a publishing editor for three yearsmanaging five academic journals I saw this happen with one paper, and eventhat that was considered unusual.</p><p>The patent system currently seems to work in completely the opposite way.The bar for having a patent approved seems quite low, but even afteracceptance of a patent the rewards are not guaranteed until after the patenthas been challenged in a court. The interrogation happens after the laurelhas been bestowed, and only in cases where there is contention that theremight actually be money to be made, which seems to be the real reward thatdrives people to patent their ideas rather than publish them.</p><p>Now why is this the case? I would offer this idea. Patent offices areessentially national bodies. This means that compared to the growth ofacademic journals there are relatively few of them. The academic systemprovides a distributed means of testing the goodness of the ideas, and so asthe volume of academic submissions has risen the journal system has beenable to scale with the growth and been able to cope.</p><p>While patent applications remained mainly technical it was possible for acentralized office to cope with the volume, but the advent of softwarepatents has dramatically changed the balance. (I'm not saying that theseideas are essentially less valuable intrinsically, but rather that theexplosion of people literate in creating though the meduium of computer codehas increased dramitaclly the volume of patents that are being filed). Underthis increase in volume the national patent office system has simply broken.Where it now finds it's scalability is in the court system. There are lotsof courts and lots of lawyers versed in patent law. I am not sure that anyfix to the patent office, or to the information that is required to submit apatent is going to get rid of the problem of scalability as long as theoffice remains a centralized organization, but I might well be dead wrongabout this.</p><p>In what could be a worrying parallel to the way that the patent system hasgone the peer review system is beginning to experience strain. It is clearthat it is key in the scientific process, however the vast numbers ofqualified scientists coming out of China and India are beginning to greatlyincrease the submission rate to academic journals. The peer review system isbeginning to creak under the weight. I hasten to add that it is working justfine at the moment, but consequences can be seen in the growing importanceof various citation indiceies. A publication on its own is no longersufficient for the advancement of most academic carerrs. It usually has tocome with additional properties, such as being in a popular journal, beingcited a certain number of times.</p><p>Another interesting development is that in some scientific areas patents arereplacing peer-reviewed publications. I know of a few groups working onnanotechnology where they have results that could be published in a peerreviewed journal, but to do so might infringe on IP. In other cases therevenue from industry that the groups are attracting mean that at the momentthey don't have the time to commit to writing up their results forpeer-review.</p><p>Are the two systems getting closer again?</p><p>Could the patent system benefit from having different levels of quality inthe way that the peer-review system has different quality journals? Agold-standard patent requiring full code disclosure and bug-free runningprogram, with a bronze-standard patent being equivalent to the currentlevel?</p><p>How can both systems utilize collective intelligence to alleviate thenumerical and informational pressure that surrounds the act of review?</p><p>Though a word of caution, if you have answerers to the above questions youshould probably patent them, shhh now.</p> <p>   </p> </div>
